  content: "The Fatherland vs. Mother Russia.  Think about it.\r\n\r\nClothaire Rapaille
    writes about this in his book <i>The Culture Code</i> which I heartily recommend.
    \ Fascinating to consider how much implied meaning is encoded in the gender of
    a noun.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, if you think a moon can't have sex, you've never
    been mooned in a gay bar before."

<p>I was taking some meeting minutes with a colleague yesterday. We did the whole meeting German -- it was all native speakers <em>bis auf</em> Yours Truly, so there was no reason not to. But we wanted to record the decisions and action plans in English, since the wider audience is not likely to be just German-speakers. This happens pretty frequently where I work.</p>
<p>I noticed we were using plenty of <em>Denglish</em> (that is also a fact of life in my line of work), and for a distraction at the end of a tiring day I asked about the gender of all those English words we'd employed in the discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>die</strong> Farm (as opposed to <em>der</em> Bauernhof)</li>
<li><strong>der</strong> Level (as opposed to <em>die</em> Ebene or <em>die</em> Schicht)</li>
<li><strong>der</strong> View (as opposed to <em>die</em> Sicht or <em>die</em> Maske)</li>
<li><strong>die</strong> Mail, because <em>die</em> Nachricht (but some say <em>das</em> Mail)</li>
</ul>
<p>I got faux ornery <sup><a id="1" href="#faux">1</a></sup> at my colleague.  I asked him, accusingly, "so how did the entire German <em>Rasse</em> <sup><a href="rasse" id="2">2</a></sup> collectively decide which gender to assign to which words you imported from my native language you obviously prefer over perfectly usable equivalent terms in your own <em>Muttersprache?</em></p>
<p>His answer:  <!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Well, we usually just keep the gender from the original language.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guffawed.  "These are all English words.  They don't have a gender at all.  You have arbitrarily chosen one for them in your language!"</p>
<p>His response:  "Yes, but...wait, does that mean you really don't think of...I don't know, the Moon, as masculine or feminine?"</p>
<p>My retort:  <em>"Kann er bumsen?"</em></p>
<p>His rebuttal:  <em>"Nein, aber der Mann im Mond!</em>"</p>
<p>My reply:  <em>"Ja, der schon, aber sein Wohnort nicht!"</em></p>
<p>The Sun and Moon are nice examples, since German flips the gender roles around there, compared to Romance languages.  I pontificated thusly:  "Our languages are really quite similar, especially considering the differences between, say, Ancient Egyptian and Mandarin.  But despite our similarities, there must be something fundamentally different between our two languages if you never considered that we have no deep-down-unexpressable feeling that the inanimate objects have inherently masculine or feminine aspects."</p>
<p>We got into a few edge cases, like <span class="german">das Mädchen</span>, but that's easily explained away to <a href="http://www.bergburg.net/neuter-is-cuter/">diminuitives</a>.  I said "look what you did to that poor girl, taking away her gender completely!"  He justified it with <span class="german">das Kind</span> as OK, so maybe <span class="german">das Mädchen</span> is NBD... But <span class="german">der Junge</span> <sup><a id="3" href="#junge">3</a></sup> gets to keep his masculine...um, article.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this discussion:  <em>I've had it before</em> -- with other native German speakers, talented in English and other European languages.</p>
<p>This opened a whole new <span class="german term" title="barrel, keg">Fass:</span> <sup><a id="4" href="#fass">4</a></sup>  how much does gender in one's native language (or the lack thereof) influence our abilities to <strong>really</strong> understand foreign speakers, or native speakers when we are the foreign speakers?</p>
