  content: Don't forget "eventuell"! I once got in a lot of trouble when I said I
    would get something done eventually (in English). (In German it means "maybe".)

<p><span class="german">Ich habe mich blamiert</span> by thinking <span class="german">blamieren</span> meant the same thing as the English verb "to blame."  It looks just like it!  Who could blame me?  Perhaps no one, except I myself. <!--more--></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>German</th>
<th colspan="2">English</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="german">Art</td>
<td>type, style, method</td>
<td>I have to remind German speakers misusing "art" that we're probably not talking about <span class="german">Kunst.</span> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">bekommen</td>
<td>to get (as in receive)</td>
<td>It does not mean "to become" &mdash; that's <span class="german">werden.</span>  However, there is an archaic link.  <span title="When did she deliver her baby?" class="term german">Wann hat sie ihr Baby bekommen?</span> is perfectly standard modern German, which reminds us of those biblical family relationships:<br />
<blockquote style="font-size:small;">And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">begat</span> a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth...</p></blockquote>
<p>"Begat" reminds us of <span class="german term" title="King Philip Came Over From GERMANY Stoned">Gattung,</span> which means "genus," so there's another link to reproduction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german"><span class="term" title="jemanden">jmdn.</span> blamieren</td>
<td>to embarrass someone</td>
<td>You'll only have yourself to blame if you embarrass yourself by confusing <span class="german">blamieren</span> and "to blame"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">sensibel</td>
<td>sensitive</td>
<td>It looks like sensible, but it's totally not.  If you mean "sensible," you probably want <span class="german">vern&uuml;nftig</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">aktuell</td>
<td>current, currently</td>
<td>Looks a lot like "actual," but "actual" should be expressed as <span class="german" title="indeed!">tats&auml;chlich</span>, meaning "in actual fact."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">Mobbing / mobben</td>
<td>Um&hellip;harassment?</td>
<td>A local native explained to me that mobbing can <span class="german">sehr wohl</span> be perpetrated by just one person.  So perhaps Germany has completely cut the word loose from its supposed English origins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">das Handy</td>
<td>mobile telephone, cellie</td>
<td>Plenty of Germans now realize that this is not an English word and that native English speakers do not use it in that way.  Still, in German, speaking with Germans, it is, well, <em>handy</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">eventuell</td>
<td>maybe, perhaps</td>
<td>See Damon's comment below.</td>

<p>Beat these apparently easy connections between German and English out of your brain.  They will entice you with their familiarity and then at best make you feel silly (um...ten years) later when you realize you've been doing it wrong, and at worst derail your otherwise confident, fluent conversation with local natives.</p>
<p>What are some false friends you've stumbled over?</p>
