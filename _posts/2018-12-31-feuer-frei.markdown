Freedom is a complex topic.  German complicates matters with the word <span class="german">frei</span> and derivatives.

### Meanings ###
I'll argue there are (at least) three or four general meanings to words based on <span class="german">frei.</span>  In some contexts, they seem contradictory, or at least not clearly separate.  Native English speakers:  before you get all judgy, heads up!  We have the same ambiguity in our <span class="german">Muttersprache.</span>  Of course that's because "free" has linguistic kinship with <span class="german">frei,</span> but I think there's more to it than that.  We use "free" in all these ways, too.

- allowed, available or exempt
- lacking (or prohibited?)
- gratis or libre:  <span class="german">kostenlos</span>
- outdoors

#### Allowed, Available or Exempt ####
<a title="Richard Bartz [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], from Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Befreiungshalle_Kelheim_BS.jpg"><img style="float:right;margin-left:5px;"  width="256" alt="Befreiungshalle Kelheim BS" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Befreiungshalle_Kelheim_BS.jpg/256px-Befreiungshalle_Kelheim_BS.jpg"></a>
For this meaning of <span class="german">frei,</span> think "Bill of Rights" -- freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom from oppression, stuff like that.  There are places named after this kind of freedom:  <span class="german">Münchener Freiheit</span> and <span class="german">Danziger Freiheit</span> come to mind (even though [it's the same place!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchner_Freiheit)).  The <a class="german" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befreiungshalle">Befreiungshalle</a> in Kelheim probably warrants a visit (we keep meaning to...).  King Ludwig I was so happy to be free of the French (i.e., <em>libéré des Français</em>, not [*les Forces françaises libres*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_France)) that he had this monument built over 20 years in the middle of the 19th century.

<em class="german">"Entschuldigung, ist hier noch frei?"</em>
<div style="display:inline;float:left;margin-right:5px;width:200px;">
<a href="/assets/img/feuer-frei/eine_stelle_ist_frei_400.jpg"><img style="float:left;" src="/assets/img/feuer-frei/eine_stelle_ist_frei_200.jpg"></a><br/><small>Apparently this brain is hiring bodies.</small></div>Anyone who's been in Germany for ten minutes has learned that phrase.  But it's not just about a place to sit.  It can refer to many kinds of availability.  <br style="clear:both;"/>





On traffic signs, <span class="german">frei</span> means "the indicated type of traffic is exempt from the rule we just stated."  <a href="/assets/img/feuer-frei/3_kinds_of_frei.jpg"><img style="float:right;margin-left:5px;" src="/assets/img/feuer-frei/3_kinds_of_frei_200x267.jpg"></a>Thus, this waterfront area on the Danube is a pedestrian zone, but bikes are cool.  Oh, also delivery traffic at certain times of day.  Oh yeah, and taxis can drive up to the ships.  But maybe only if they're bus-shaped taxis?<br style="clear:both;"/>

#### Lacking (or Prohibited?) ####
Beer/pasta/cola with no alcohol/gluten/caffeine in it?  That's a <span class="german">alkohol-/gluten-/koffeinfreies Getränk.</span>  That seems pretty clear.  But is an <span class="german">arbeitsfreier Tag</span> one on which you are <em>prohibited</em> from working or just a day that lacks work?  And it seems pretty clear that a <span class="german">rauchfreies Hotelzimmer</span> is not merely one that has not been smoked in &mdash; smoking in one of those is certainly prohibited and will net you a fine.

#### Gratis or Libre:  <span class="german">kostenlos</span> ####
<div style="margin:5px;padding:5px;float:right; display:inline;width:200px;"><img style="float:right;" src="/assets/img/feuer-frei/good_grammar_costs_nothing.gif"><br style="clear:both;"/><small>I bought my mom this Glarkware tee-shirt a few years back.  I'm not sure I agree anymore.  Life in Germany has taught me it's more of an investment with an intangible pay-off.</small></div><img src="/assets/img/feuer-frei/freibier_gibts_morgen.png"><br/>Gratis means you don't have to pay for it.  Libre means you can do what you want with it.  <span class="german">Frei</span> can mean either (or both) of those things.  <span class="german">Freibier</span> is an admirable concept.  But despite a superficial resemblance, a <span class="german">Freibad</span> is neither <em>libre</em> (you gotta follow their rules) nor <em>gratis</em> (one of which is paying admission).<br style="clear:both;"/>

#### Outdoors ####
"Open-air" is the term I think of when <span class="german">frei</span> is used in connection with a venue.  The excellent <a class="german" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96sterreichisches_Freilichtmuseum">Österreichisches Freilichtmuseum</a> is a perfect embodiment of this concept.  Go visit it on a nice day when you're near Graz.

Let's close it out with an important thought going back to the High Middle Ages but more recently put to good use again -- might need to that one in our backpocket:

And now, on the last day of the year, here in Germany, it's getting really close to midnight, so break out those fireworks if you don't worry about various kinds of pollution and scaring any animals, and ...
