<p>German, for whatever weird reason, thinks anything is cuter, nicer, <span title="more adorable" class="german term">hinrei&szlig;ender</span> if its gender has been removed.  (Let's not get all Freudian about this, okay?  Keep in mind that the <strong>words</strong> have gender, not the objects they represent.  <footnote>Thanks, <a href="http://www.geekmadel.com">Geekmadel.</a></footnote>  Well, sometimes.  Argh.)</p>
<p>If you're going to get cutesy on something in German, you do that by adding a suffix and an umlaut where possible (or not, just to be <span class="german" title="contrary">trotzig</span>, particularly in southern dialects), and, um, neutering it.  <!--more--></p>
<p>Exactly which suffix you'll use might depend on the region.</p>

<p>So what about the word for "boy"?  One might rightfully expect a diminutive <span class="german">das</span> word for boy, following the same pattern.  There is one, but it doesn't seem contemporary:  <span class="german">Bübchen</span>.  If there is a more commonly-used neuter, diminutive word for male children, please let us know about it in the comments.</p>
<p>Getting the gender wrong on stuff is frustrating, but it happens, and it's pretty much never fatal.  But on diminutives, you don't have to.  The rule is very reliable:  <em>Neuter is cuter.</em></p>

    <div id="weib">
        <small>1.  Tread carefully here, gents.  It's perfectly OK to describe a female animal as a <span class="german">Weibchen</span> (or a male one as a <span class="german">Männchen</span>).  But don't use <span class="german">Weib</span> without considering its implications, into which we shall not delve.  You pretty much don't hear <span class="german">Fräulein</span> anymore, either.  The only two times I've ever heard the natives use it:
            <ul>
            <li>My host father used it against his ten-year-old daughter who was having a diabetic freak-out in the early 1990s.</li>
            <li>A senior citizen couple used it to attract the attention of the young waitress last year in a <span class="german">Biergarten,</span> and they obviously meant nothing negative by it.</li>
            </ul>  
        <a href="#1">&uarr;</a></small> 
    </div>
    <div id="mad">
        <small>2.  Nobody says <span class="german">Mad</span> anymore.  It's archaic.  But I have heard a colleague who leans on his Fränkish roots in times of emotion use the word <span class="german">Madele</span> as an epithet against a female colleague who was annoying him.  And thus we have arrived at why the German word for "girl" is neuter, and not feminine as you might think.  As such, this is perfectly correct:  <span title="The girl is eating her müsli." class="german">Das Mädchen isst <em>sein</em> Müsli.</span>  <span class="german">Sein?</span>  Really?  Yes, really.  The possessive pronoun for any neuter word in German is <span class="german">sein.</span>  <a href="#2">&uarr;</a></small>
    </div>
    <div id="kanin">
        <small>3.  Couple things:  
            <ul>
            <li>We are not aware of a commonly-used non-diminiutive word for bunny, other than Hase (and that's arguably not the word for bunny).  German Wikipedia reports <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaninchen#Etymologie">Kanin</a> as an archaic term still in use among furriers.  There are more terms, like <span class="german">Kanickel, Karnickel, Künglein, and Chinigl,</span> but they all appear to have a diminutive tacked onto them and may also be obsolete anyway.</li>
            <li>Apart from <em>Watership Down</em> and <em>Donnie Darko</em>, show me any bunny who is not worthy of a cutifier.</li>
            </ul>
