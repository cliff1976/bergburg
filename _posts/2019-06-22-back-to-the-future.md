When you need to postpone an appointment, in German that's a <span class="german">Verschiebung.</span>  Most frequently, at least where I work, <span class="german">Termine werden nach hinten verschoben,</span>  i.e. rescheduled to a point in the future.

<span class="german">Nach hinten?  Wirklich?</span>

Let's think about that for a minute.

I always thought <span class="german">Nach hinten</span> means "behind &#123;you&#124;me&#124;us&#125;."  Postponing something means to push it off into the future.  Behind you.

Are German-speakers oriented on the past?  Here is a very crude ASCII diagram depicting my point.

|          (das sind wir)           |

If <span class="german">nach hinten</span> is behind you, and it also means the future, then you must be facing the past.  Right?

<blockquote class="german">Wir m√ºssen den Termin um zwei Wochen nach Hinten verschieben.</blockquote>

My native English-speaking gut tells me the equivalent expression in English would be: 

> "We're going to have to push that meeting off by two weeks."

Or maybe: 

> "We're going to have to push that meeting back by two weeks."

Aha.  Push it back.  As if the *appointment* had a face, is facing us, and we want to move the date of the meeting to a point on the timeline behind the appointment.  Bonus crude ASCII diagram:

| past       __/^\__             __/^\__       future  |

|              us           the appointment            |

Is *that* what they mean by <span class="german">nach hinten?</span>
