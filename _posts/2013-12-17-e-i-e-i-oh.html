<p>When I started at the local U.S. subsidiary HQ of a big German electronics conglomerate, I was amazed at how many local native English speakers could say the name of our company without flinching (hint:  rhymes with "Beemans"), but were always unsure how to pronounce transplanted-from-Germany names if they contained an EI or IE vowel combination.</p>
<p>It's really not hard in German.  But given the</p>
<blockquote><p>I before E, except under plenty of totally arbitrary circumstances</p></blockquote>
<p>maxim many of us learned while trying to master the English spelling of achieve and receive and believe and onomatopoeia, perhaps you can't blame the native anglophones for being a little <span title="wobbly" class="german term">wackelig</span> about the sounds E and I make when used together in other languages, too.</p>
<p>It breaks down like this:<!--more-->  for any EI or IE or AI combination, as in</p>
<ul class="german">EI</p>
<li>Ei</li>
<li>Reis</li>
<li>Gleis</li>
<li>Preis</li>
<li>Maisel's Wei&szlig;e</li>
</ul>
<ul class="german">IE</p>
<li>Diebstahl</li>
<li>Miete</li>
<li>Prien am Chiemsee</li>
<li>wieder</li>
<li>zufrieden</li>
</ul>
<ul class="german">AI</p>
<li>Kaiser</li>
<li>Main</li>
<li>Maisel's Wei&szlig;e</li>
<li>Waisenkind</li>
</ul>
<p>All you have to do is say the <strong>English</strong> <em>name</em> of the second vowel.</p>
<p>Wait&hellip;  What?</p>
<p>It's true.  For any German word, this rule holds true.  All bets are off on imported words, or words like <span class="german">Familie</span>, where the I and the E are forming different syllables.</p>
<p>OK, but what about the Y combinations, smart guy?</p>
<p>Please recall that in many languages (at least two come to mind), a Y is nothing but a Greek I (<em>por ejemplo, "i griega" en el espa&ntilde;ol</em>).  So that's why all the many ways to write the name</p>
<ul class="german">
<li>Maier</li>
<li>Mayer</li>
<li>Meier</li>
<li>Meyer</li>
</ul>
<p>result in the same pronunciation.  Treat those Y's like I's, and the rule holds true again &mdash; as well as the caveats.  Pronounce the AY in <span class="german">Haarspray</span> like the English word spray (but not the <span class="german">Haar,</span> natch!).  Oddly enough, we have heard "okay" pronounced in German by Germans in informal situations as "okai" (rhymes with "eye") when indicating a resolution to an open question or acknowledging that a process has reached its logical conclusion (at least for the present).  Not sure what that's about.</p>
<p>What's the big deal if you get IE and EI mixed up in practice?  Probably nothing.  But if you don't know the difference between <span title="spear" class="german term">Spie&szlig;</span> and <span title="archaic word for food" class="term german">Speis</span>, <span title="to shoot" class="term german">schie&szlig;en</span> und <span title="to shit" class="term german">schei&szlig;en</span>, then you'll sound pretty silly.  Especially if you goof up <span title="to shit" class="term german">schei&szlig;en</span>.</p>
