<h3 class="german">das Geschlecht</h3>
<p>Is there anything inherently bad about gender?</p>
<blockquote><p>No, of course not!</p></blockquote>
<p>says the modern, well-educated thinker. <sup><a id="1" href="#except">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And yet, one can't help but shake the impression that gender, or at least the physiological aspects, have a negative tinge to them. If one is a foreign observer of German, that is.</p>
<p>How's that?  Because <span class="german">Geschlecht.</span></p>
<p>"Bad!" leaps out at you from the German word for "gender."  Or "sex," in some contexts. <sup><a id="2" href="#whether">2</a></sup>  <span class="german">Schlecht</span> is one of those words you taught yourself to stumble through upon arrival <span class="german">ins Vaterland</span> while explaining your lack of language prowess to the nice border control people at the airport.</p>
<blockquote class="german"><p> Entschuldigung, mein Deutsch ist sehr schlecht.</p></blockquote>
<p>And when you spray them with that combo of CH and T at the end, you'll have convinced them. <sup><a id="3" href="#plexi">3</a></sup>  See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2013-12-22-ch.html %}" title="CH">here</a> for help with that CH-precipitation.</p>
<p>But I digress.  Let's come back to gender:  what can we conclude about it?  Is it truly linked to bad, evil, sub-par-ness or other negativity, somewhere deep in the psyche of the typical native speaker?</p>
<p>"No, of course not -- not anymore, at least."  We'd like to think that.  But consider that the last bastion of defense of your <span class="german term" title="the naughty bits">Geschlechtsteile,</span> unless you've taken measures to the contrary, are nearby, both physiologically and emotionally:  your <span class="german term" title="pubes">Schamhaare</span> -- "shame hairs."</p>
<h3>Reluctance to Drop Trou</h3>
<p>Have you ever caught a German colleague in a mistake he's made and was hoping no one would notice?  If he acknowledges his misfortune at all, you may hear him dejectedly admit:</p>
<blockquote class="german"><p>Mei, da muss ich wohl die Hose runterlassen...</p></blockquote>
<p>This would imply that he's not really looking forward to exposing his bits.  It's an expression about facing up to your shame, which is normally kept properly stowed in your pants. <sup><a id="4" href="#brit">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="verkehr-412" class="german">der Verkehr</h3>
<p>It means "traffic," as a noun.  But watch out -- when it's a past participle serving as an adverb or adjective, as in <span class="german">verkehrt,</span> it means "backwards," and usually denotes something did not go as planned. Kind of like how "backwards" as an adjective in English implies developmental difficulty.</p>
<h3 class="german">der Geschlechtsverkehr</h3>
<p>Literally, "gender traffic," it's a cold, clinical way of describing...yeah, just what you thought.  Though one of the translations for <span class="german">Verkehr</span> I found was "communion," which at first sounds kind of nice, until I was reminded of a certain sacrament from my Catholic upbringing.</p>
