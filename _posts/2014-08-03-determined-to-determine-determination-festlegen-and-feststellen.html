<p>If you work in German, you've probably encountered these words before: <span class="german">festlegen</span> and <span class="german">feststellen.</span> While they both ostensibly translate to "to determine" in English, and they have a lot of other similarities, they definitely have distinct meanings.</p>
<p>Let's start with what they have in common:<!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>First off, they're both <strong>transitive</strong> and <strong>regular</strong>. <sup><a id="1" href="#trans">1</a></sup>   <strong>Transitive</strong> means means the verb needs an object. <strong>Regular</strong> means you can count on them to follow conjugation rules -- in this case, for all persons and tenses. So no need to memorize the quirks of these two verbs -- <span class="german term" title="There aren't any!">es gibt keine!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are both separable-prefix verbs. You know, those ones whose prepositional component kind of breaks off from the rest of verb and waits patiently at the end of the clause <sup><a href="#subord" id="2">2</a></sup>, preventing your conversational partner from jumping in and prematurely interjecting.  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/">German Wikipedia</a> has some <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A4fix#Trennbare_und_untrennbare_Verben">good examples</a> of separable prefix verbs and their permutations if you need a refresher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <em class="term" title="I love saying that!">nounify</em> them both with <span class="german">-ung,</span> which is great, because then you automatically know their gender.  <span class="german">-ung</span> is <em>reknowned</em> for its reliable femininity. <sup><a id="3" href="#see">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they both can be translated as "to determine."  Whoa, Nellie.  Hold up there a minute.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To determine</strong> doesn't always mean the same thing in English.  Learning <span class="german">festlegen</span> and <span class="german">feststellen</span> has even helped me to see that some of its meanings are even contradictory.</p>
<h3 class="german">feststellen</h3>
<p>When you <span class="german">stell</span> something <span class="german">fest,</span> you are putting it firmly in its place, as if it were not a completely known quantity beforehand, but <span class="german">nach der Festellung,</span> both its location and momentum are known. <sup><a href="#heisenberg" id="4">4</a></sup>  So <span class="german">feststellen</span> means "to determine" in the sense of "solve for <em>x</em>."</p>
<h3 class="german">festlegen</h3>
<p>This is another beast completely -- one we have bent to our will in the very moment of performing our <span class="german">Festlegung.</span>  Here we are not merely passive observers, trying to make sense of the universe.  We are <em>determining</em> our own fate, by actively firming <span class="german">(fest)</span> up our path through space and time.</p>

<p>With a little determination, it's clear that determining <span class="german">festlegen</span> and <span class="german">feststellen's</span> separate meanings are neither rocket science nor quantum physics.  And it also sheds a little light on the complexities foreign speakers of English face.</p>
