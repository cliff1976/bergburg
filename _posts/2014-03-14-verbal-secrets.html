  content: "Oh yeah, and is anyone brave enough to ask a native speaker <span class=\"german\">warum
    das Buch MICH f&uuml;nf Euro kostet</span> and not <span class=\"german\">MIR?</span>
    \ Is there an <span class=\"german\">Akkusativ-Geheimnis</span> attached to <span
    class=\"german\">kosten?</span>\r\n\r\nOn second thought, the average native speaker
    probably isn't the best reference after all.  Ask a grammarian; ideally someone
    who gets paid to explain this sort of thing."

<p>Shhhhhh.  Keep this under your hat.  Some German verbs are living a lie, hiding a terrible <span class="german term" title="secret">Geheimnis</span>.</p>
<p>This is a lesson from the <span class="german term" title="Volkshochschule">VHS.</span>  Some verbs objectify a little oddly for our tastes as native English speakers.  Saying <span class="german">"*Ich helfe dich"</span> would earn you an urgent stage-whisper from the instructor:  <span class="german">"Psscht!  Was ist das Geheimnis von <em>helfen?!</em>"</span><a id="1" href="#psst"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For some of these verbs, you can sort of see a reason for another object in the English translation's use of a preposition.  For others, there is just no discernible reason for these verbs to force their objects into case-drag.  <a href="#hose" id="2"><sup>2</sup></a><!--more--> </p>

<p><span class="german">Entsprechen</span> and <span class="german">bed&uuml;rfen</span> are two that come to mind as somewhat understandable, since they correspond to common English equivalent expressions having need of a preposition to get the meaning across properly.</p>
<p>See what I did there?</p>
<p>You couldn't, in good conscience, say "*Your software solution corresponds exactly my expectations."  "To correspond" in English requires an extra preposition before its object.  That's your clue that its German equivalent might be one of those Dative-forcing verbs.</p>
<p><span class="german">Bed&uuml;rfen</span> is even trickier, because</p>
<ol>
<li>it's got a <span title="one of those vampire verbs that don't work right by themselves, like 'can'" class="term">modal</span> verb snuck in there, so you've got the atypical conjugation of <span class="german">d&uuml;rfen</span> to worry about, and </li>
<li>it's fancy.  You probably could just use some form of <span title="to need" class="term german">brauchen,</span> which is gloriously mundane in every possible way, including its treatment of objects, or in some contexts <span title="to require" class="term german">verlangen,</span> which is very nearly equally boring.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I thank you for having read this far, who is the subject?    I am, of course.  Who is the object?  You are.  There are no other parties involved &mdash; just you and me.  What's the action here?  The thanking.  The action is acting directly upon...[drumroll please]...you.  So why the hell doesn't "you" behave like a direct object (Accusative) here?  That's the <span class="german">Dativ-Geheimnis</span> of <span class="german">danken.  Kannst Du <strong>mir</strong> folgen?</span></p>
