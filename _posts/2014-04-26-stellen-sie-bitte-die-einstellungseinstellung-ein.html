<p>There's a lot going on in the title here, but without some context, it's not clear at all what.<!--more--></p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th class="german">Deutsch</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">einstellen</td>
<td>to terminate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">einstellen</td>
<td>to hire</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">einstellen</td>
<td>to adjust</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>And likewise:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th class="german">Deutsch</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">Einstellung</td>
<td>cancellation, cessation, termination</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">Einstellung</td>
<td>hiring, recruitment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="german">Einstellung</td>
<td>adjustment, attitude, setting</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Conceivable translations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please cancel the attitude adjustment.</li>
<li>Please adjust the recruitment cancellation.</li>
<li>Please set the settings setting.  <a href="#andy" id="1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Please hire the cancellation attitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, that last one is pretty much nonsense and the one before it seems <span title="exaggerated" class="term german">&uuml;berspitzt.</span></p>
<p>For all the purported logical, modular <em>verbal Lego&reg;-ness</em> and derivability, there are several words in the typical German-language office that challenge the foreign pencil-pusher.  <a href="#maus" id="2"><sup>2</sup></a>  Likely everyone else around the <strike>water-cooler</strike> <span class="german">Teek&uuml;che</span> will derive from context which meaning of <span class="german">einstellen</span> is appropriate, and it's clear that the example in the title is convoluted.</p>
<p>It may be important to note, however, that one meaning is "recruitment" (related to labor contracts) and the another is seemingly its direct opposite, "termination" (but <em>not</em> related to labor contracts -- that would be <span class="german">k&uuml;ndigen</span>, which is more like "to give notice").  Two contradictory concepts wrapped up in just one word like that is a deplorable state of affairs.</p>
<p>But we can't sanction (them for) that, can we?</p>
<p><strong>What other German words appear to speak with a split tongue?</strong>  <a href="#zunge" id="3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
